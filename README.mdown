# Gedit PHPKit Plugin

[Re-Work In Progress] A toolkit to ease PHP development for Gedit 2.

## Notes

* This would be a complete rewrite of my old [phpkit](https://bitbucket.org/iromli/gedit-phpkit-old/overview) plugin.
* Currently, `phpkit` read the completion proposals from `json` files generated by [propose](https://github.com/iromli/propose) (PHP library).
